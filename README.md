I used modulo for the decimal to roman numeral conversion, which works, but doesn't take advantage of the fact that you can a roman numeral before a larger roman numeral to subtract. For example, 903 could be written "CM", but my function does "DCCCC" instead. I couldn't quite figure out a clean way to implement this rule though.
